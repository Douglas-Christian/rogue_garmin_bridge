# Rogue to Garmin Bridge Project Plan

## Project Overview

The Rogue to Garmin Bridge is a Python application designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 2. It connects to Rogue Echo Bike and Rower equipment via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) using the FTMS (Fitness Machine Service) standard, collects workout metrics, and converts them to the Garmin FIT file format for upload to Garmin Connect. The application includes a web-based user interface for configuration, monitoring, and managing workout data.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Bluetooth Compatibility Issues**
   - **Risk**: Raspberry Pi 2 may have limitations with Bluetooth connectivity
   - **Mitigation**: Test early with actual hardware, consider external Bluetooth adapter if needed

2. **FTMS Protocol Implementation**
   - **Risk**: Rogue Echo equipment may have non-standard FTMS implementation
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing with actual devices, implement flexible protocol handling

3. **FIT File Compatibility**
   - **Risk**: Generated FIT files may not be fully compatible with Garmin Connect
   - **Mitigation**: Strict adherence to Garmin specifications, thorough testing with Garmin Connect

4. **Performance Limitations**
   - **Risk**: Raspberry Pi 2 may have performance limitations for real-time processing
   - **Mitigation**: Optimize code, consider asynchronous processing, test with realistic workloads

### Project Risks

1. **Scope Creep**
   - **Risk**: Project scope may expand beyond initial requirements
   - **Mitigation**: Clear definition of MVP, prioritize features, use agile approach

2. **Timeline Delays**
   - **Risk**: Development may take longer than estimated
   - **Mitigation**: Build buffer into timeline, prioritize critical features

3. **Testing Limitations**
   - **Risk**: Limited access to actual hardware for testing
   - **Mitigation**: Create simulators for testing, schedule dedicated testing periods

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test individual functions and methods
- Use pytest for automated testing
- Implement continuous integration if possible

### Integration Testing
